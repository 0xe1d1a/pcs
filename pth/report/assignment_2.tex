\begin{homeworkProblem}[Introduction]

For this assignment, we were asked to complete four sub-assignments involving writing code using pthreads (or related
lower-level concurrency functionality) and perform experiments involving them. The four sub-assignments we will discuss
further are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallelizing our sequential/OpenMP heat dissipation implementation using the pthread library.
\item Experimenting with the concepts of mutual exclusion, barriers, critical sections and semaphores. Specifically, we implemented a generic barrier which
	uses either mutex locks combined with condition variables, sempahores or the built-in posix functions.
\item Implementing a sorting algorithm which uses a pipeline of threads and bounded buffers.
\item Implementing (somehow) a generic program that can be used to experiment with constructs such as STM (Software Transactional Memory) and readers-writer locks. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{homeworkProblem}[Heat dissipation | pthreads]
\textbf{Solution description}

We took our OpenMP solution from the last assignment, and converted it to use pthreads.

To avoid operating system overhead, similarly to OpenMP, we spawned threads only once (at startup). Since the
problem is embarassingly parallelizable in a statically scheduled manner, we can assign each thread a specific
section of rows (since we know the matrix sizes at startup), which it is responsible for dealing with for the
entire runtime of the computation. This is presumably fairly similar to the way the OpenMP code works.

We pass this information to the threads at startup in a struct, and they pass reduction data back.

\csnippet{threadspwn}{Creation and work assignment of threads}

\csnippet{reductions}{Reductions performed on master thread}

The threads then repeatedly execute the heat dissipation computation work in a loop (performing the reduction
also, if necessary), and pthread barriers are used as necessary to make the threads run in lockstep per-iteration.
In our initial implementation (see the later discussion), we used one barrier to sync the start of the main loop
(to work out whether we needed to perform reduction, for example), one barrier after the computation work and
one barrier after the reduction (if performed).

\csnippet{synch}{Barrier synchronization}

Threads keep local copies of some state (such as the next/prev pointers) to simplify synchronisation problems,
although the excessive use of barriers in this implementation makes this somewhat unnecessary.

When we finish execution, we simply walk through and cancel all the threads, rather than tidying up after them
nicely. This made the code simpler to write, and the negative consequences are irrelevant for the limited scope
of this assignment.

\textbf{Evaluation - Experiments}

We run our experiments on the DAS-4 system, using normal nodes which has 8 physical cores.
The results are extremely similar to those we obtained using OpenMP, so we only conducted a limited set of
experiments, with the following parameters:

\begin{verbatim}
./heat -e 0.0 -i 2000 -k 2001
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{effectivness.png}

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{walltime.png}

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{speedup.png}

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{effect_seq_cmp.png}

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{wt_seq_cmp.png}

As you can see, the results for 8 threads are extremely suspicious. We concluded that the most
likely explanation is due to the fact that we're 8 threads plus a master thread, and that since
the master thread must wake up for all threads to pass the barrier, we are presumably encountering
scheduling problems on the 8-core machines.

\textbf{Tweaks and improvements}

We made two major changes to the dissipation code after the above experiments:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Doing computation on the master thread: we only spawn $n-1$ threads (when
asked to use $n$ threads), and do the remaining computation on the master thread.
This improved the situation for 8 threads, but (as we will see) not enough.

\item Removing two barriers: we reduced the number of barriers to one single barrier,
by making threads maintain more state themselves (specifically the iteration count,
which they can all check individually to see whether they should do reduction or stop
iterating). This didn't lead to a substantial performance improvement.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Evaluation - Comparison with OpenMP}

As you can see from the graphs below, as mentioned already, our final performance (except in the 8-thread case
mentioned) is extremely similar to that of our previous OpenMP implementation, both without reductions
(or rather, only with a single final reduction) and with reductions at every step. This is exactly what we
expected, since the OpenMP overhead is fairly low, and we are (hopefully) doing most things in a similar
way.

\textbf{Unresearched questions}

We did not explore potential improvements which could result from requesting different
behaviour from pthreads, such as pinning threads to a certain core (affinity) nor tweaking
behaviour like busywaiting.

\end{homeworkProblem}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	Barriers
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}[Barrier synchronisation]
\textbf{Solution description}

Our solution uses a union with different barrier data types in it, to provide a unified interface for experimenting,
allowing the user to select a barrier type with command-line parameters, and the exact same client-facing (this is super
cool buzzword terminology meaning `interface') code can be used for all cases.

We implemented several types of barriers, as requested:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Standard Posix barriers (\texttt{pthread\_barrier\_wait} etc).
\item Mutex locks and condition variables (\texttt{pthread\_cond\_wait} etc), in the obvious manner.
\item Semaphores. We first tried implementing this using two semaphores, one to block the threads, and
the other to act as a mutex protecting a lock on a counter. The counter was incremented with each new
waiting thread, and when it reached the appropriate value, it was reset to zero, and \texttt{sem\_post}
would be called in a loop, releasing all the threads. However, this only works once; when used in a loop,
it is possible for a thread to `rush ahead' and go through the barrier a second time, stealing the semaphore
value intended for another thread and leading to a deadlock. Therefore, our final implementation uses two
(entry and exit) barriers to avoid this problem. Also, our final code replaces the mutex lock with an atomic
increment/decrement on the counter. The original mutex code is left inside \texttt{SEM\_USE\_MUTEX} for illustrative purposes.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Evaluation}

The results of our experiments are shown below (note that we used overall runtimes, rather than per-iteration runtimes, because
the latter seemed a rather crazy idea):

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{barrier.png}

As you can see from the error bars, as soon as the operating system scheduler gets involved (i.e., beyond the), the results fluctuate massively.
This makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions, however the mutex/CV implementation appears to be considerably more efficient than the
standard Posix barriers, and the semaphores also appear competitive.

\end{homeworkProblem}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	Pipesort
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}[Pipeline parallelism]
\textbf{Solution description}

The pipeline sort works as follows: The master thread creates a bounded buffer and spawns a thread associated with the buffer. After that
it generates a sequence of numbers and pushes them one by one into the buffer, thus sending them to the thread. The thread's role is 
to receive these numbers, keep the biggest value and do the same as the generator: create a new buffer plus a new thread and send the numbers
it didn't store by pushing them into the new buffer. This is done in a recursive way until the end of sequence is signaled. This occurs
by the generator sending a special symbol into the pipeline where every thread forwards it as well as its stored number to the successor. The last thread in the pipeline spawns a special thread that prints all the numbers. In the end another special symbol is forwarded which instructs the threads
to join with each other and finally end the execution.

For the synchronization of the pushing and pulling from the bounded buffers we used
semaphores, which are ideal for this producer-consumer problem, as discussed in the slides from the lecture. Mutex locks aren't needed since for every buffer there is only a
single producer and a single consumer thus they aren't racing for particular data. The semaphores simply track the availability
of the resources (how much of the buffer is used), and if relevant, they will signal blocked threads that are waiting to insert data in a full buffer or
fetch data from an empty buffer.

\csnippet{sempushpull}{Semaphore handling on inserting or fetching a value}

\textbf{Evaluation}
The results are very not stable for sorting lengths beyond a few numbers, but this is as-expected, since a lot more threads are created than the physical cores available to handle them. This means that the scheduler plays an important role in the performance, and more importantly a role that we can't really control. In any case, the following figure depicts the evaluation of the program for a reasonably representative number of elements:

\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{pipesort.png}

As you can see, buffer lengths up to around 1000 represent clear performance improvements, but eventually the overhead of creating the buffers (in particular, the
allocation) starts to outweigh the added advantage (unsurprisingly for the values far beyond the length of the input we are sorting, which won't be used). This is
exactly as expected, since every comparator thread will send all symbols onto subsequent threads (either during the comparison phase or the output phase)
and so when we have a buffer length which is less than the total length to be sorted, it is potentially possible for this work to be done without any context
switches (even though the extremely erratic performance seems to suggest this is not actually happening).

Rather than investigating this further, since obviously the huge number of threads involved means that the whole idea is fundamentally flawed,
we tried instead using userspace/green threads (rather than pthreads) in the form of \texttt{libpth} (or rather, \texttt{pthsem}, which supports semaphores),
but the performance was much worse (perhaps unsurprisingly, since the cost of the context switches is still present in userspace, and none of the other problems
are resolved in any way).
